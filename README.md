# JPEGView - Image Viewer and Editor

This is a mod of [sylikc's official re-release of JPEGView](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/) to focus on the _**slideshow aspect and ease of use**_ of the app. Panning is now enabled by default. [AVIF image format](https://avif.io/blog/articles/avif-faq/#%E2%8F%A9generalinformation) support (include animated AVIF) has been added for viewing, and 'save as AVIF'. Latest addition is viewing of manga/comics archives (CBZ/CB7).

## Description

JPEGView is a lean, fast and highly configurable image viewer/editor with a minimal GUI.

### Formats Supported

JPEGView has built-in support the following formats:

* Popular: JPEG, GIF
* Lossless: BMP, PNG, TIFF, PSD, QOI, ICO (mod only)
* Web: WEBP, JXL, HEIF/HEIC, AVIF (common subset)
* Legacy: TGA, WDP, HDP, JXR
* Camera RAW formats:
  * Adobe (DNG), Canon (CRW, CR2, CR3), Nikon (NEF, NRW), Sony (ARW, SR2)
  * Olympus (ORF), Panasonic (RW2), Fujifilm (RAF)
  * Sigma (X3F), Pentax (PEF), Minolta (MRW), Kodak (KDC, DCR)
  * A full list is available here: [LibRaw supported cameras](https://www.libraw.org/supported-cameras)
* Manga/comics container format: CBZ/CB7.
  * And probably anything 7zip can open.
  * Valid within are a big subset of above image formats.

Many additional formats are supported by Windows Imaging Component (WIC)

### Basic Image Editor

Basic on-the-fly image processing is provided - allowing adjusting typical parameters:

* sharpness
* color balance
* rotation
* perspective
* contrast
* local under/over-exposure

### Other Features

* Small and fast, uses AVX2/SSE2 and up to 4 CPU cores
* High quality resampling filter, preserving sharpness of images
* Basic image processing tools can be applied realtime during viewing
* Movie/Slideshow mode - to play folder of JPEGs as movie

**Mod features**
* **Slideshow stuff** - see next section.
* Image formats
  * Read/write **AVIF**, include animated. Dev notes below.
  * View _largest_ icon in **ICO**
* [Experimental] **Browse manga/comics**
  * Container format: CBZ/CB7. Within can be JXL, JPG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF/HEIF, QOI, BMP or RAW images; animation ignored.
  * Navigation keys page through images in archive instead of advancing to next file. See 'Navigation' section below.
* *Default to panning mode*. Dedicated 'Selection mode' can be toggled via remapped 'S' hotkey.
   * Quick zoom to selection mode via remapped hotkey 'Z'.
   * Option for selection box to match image aspect ratio.
* **Toggle 3 transparency modes**: TransparencyColor (default), checkerboard pattern or inverse TransparencyColor, via hotkey: SHIFT+V.
* Navigation
   * **ALT+<Left/Right arrow>**: Jump back/forward 100 images.
   * **CTRL+ALT+<Left/Right arrow>**: Jump to previous/next folder.
   * Wrap backwards. Allowed for `LoopSameFolderLevel` & `LoopSubFolders` too, not just`LoopFolder`.
   * **ALT+P**: Jump back to previous opened folder if any.
   * In manga mode:
     * **Left**/**Right**: previous/next image in archive. If already at 1st or last image of archive respectively, will exit archive to previous/next image.
     * **ALT+<Left/Right arrow>**: Jump back/forward 100 images in archive. If overshoot, stop at first/last image in archive.
     * **CTRL+<Left/Right arrow>**: Exit archive to previous/next image file.
     * **ALT+G**: Enter 'goto image number' mode (toast prompt appears), key in desired number and hit **<ENTER>** to jump to that image in archive. To cancel, hit **<ESCAPE>** or let entry timeout (toast disappears).
     * Changed to **SHIFT+M**: Toggle between marked image and current image.
* Filter
  * Hide small images below `MinFilesize`. **ALT+M** to toggle and reload.
    * Enabled by default if MinFilesize > 0, but auto-disabled if 1st image opened is small (< MinFilesize).
  * `HideHidden` setting: hide hidden images and folders. **ALT+H** to toggle and reload.
  * `HideSameName` setting: ignore/skip duplicate images with same name but different extension, i.e. show only 1 of them.  **ALT+N** to toggle.
* Simplified KeyMap.txt format with direct hotkey to command ID mapping.
  * Old format still supported.
  * Use ConvertKeyMap tool to make one-off conversion if desired.
* Others
  * Release includes all necessary DLLs.
  * Toast notifications. 
  * Toggle ascending/descending sorting by pressing the same hotkey for sorting mode.
  * New settings and/or options:
    * Added `Auto` folder navigation mode to auto-choose `LoopSubFolders` (if initial folder has subfolder) or `LoopSameFolderLevel` (otherwise).
      * Command# 6000 (LOOP_FOLDER, hotkey: F7) now toggles between `LoopFolder` and `Auto`.
    * Set `MinFilesize > 0` to Hide of small images. It auto-disables temporarily if 1st image opened is small (< MinFilesize), so as to view that image as intended.
  * [Experimental]: include a mod of [mez0ru's PR for quick image show despite large folder](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/pull/172)
  * Span _nearly_ all monitors.
    * No change:
      * F12: toggles span all monitors, or not.
      * SHF+F12: toggles always on top.
        * New: Override via commandline option `/top` to enable always on top. Use `/top 0` or `/top false` to disable.
    * CTRL+F12: toggle to next monitor. Now if there are more than 2 monitors (assuming horizontal row), this hotkey toggles in this cycle: monitor #1, #2, ...  #last, all but last `[XX ]`, all but 1st `[ XX]`, and back.
 * F1 with CTRL, SHF or ALT combos can now be used as hotkeys for other commands; only F1 shows the help info.

(Last selectively sync'd up to original's ~6 Jul 2024 updates, with occasional cherry picks going ahead).

### Slideshow

JPEGView has a slideshow mode which can be activated in various ways:
* **hotkey**:
  * **ALT+R**: 'resume'/start slideshow @ default of 1fps.
  * **ALT+SHF+R** (added in mod): start slideshow @ custom interval configured via `SlideShowCustomInterval` setting in `JPEGView.ini`.
  * **one of number 1 to 9**: start slideshow with corresponding delay in seconds, i.e. 1s to 9s, when not in selection mode.
    * May get rid of these excessive selections and repurpose these hotkeys for something else more useful in future.
  * **CTRL+(one of number 1 to 9)**: start slideshow with corresponding delay in tenth of a second (number x 0.1), i.e. 0.1s to 0.9s.
  * **CTRL+SHF+(one of number 1 to 9)**: start slideshow with corresponding delay in hundredth of a second (number x 0.01), i.e. 0.01s to 0.09s.
  * **ESC**: exit slideshow.
  * **SHIFT+Space** (_**added in mod**_): start slideshow @ 1fps.
  This is added via `KeyMap.txt` file.
  * **Plus** (added in mod; when in slideshow mode): increase slideshow frame interval, i.e. slow it down, in steps. Steps are the available fps speeds listed below.
  * **Minus** (_**added in mod**_; when in slideshow mode): decrease slideshow frame interval, i.e. speed it down, in steps. Steps are the available fps speeds listed below.
  * **Space** (_**modified in mod**_; when in slideshow mode): pause/resume slideshow.
  When not in slideshow, it toggles fit to window.
* **context menu**: right click image, select "Play folder as slideshow/movie" any of the options available - which are different slideshow speeds.
  * available speeds in fps: 100, 50, 30, 25, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, 0.2, 0.143, 0.1, 0.05, and _custom_ (interval)
  * _custom_ (_**added in mod**_): as per `SlideShowCustomInterval` setting.
* **commandline**: `JPEGView.exe [optional image/path] /slideshow <interval>`
  Interval as positive floating point number with optional units, or defaults to 5s; no upper limit.
    * Units: s for secs (default if no unit specified), m for minutes, h for hours.
    * E.g.: `JPEGView.exe c:\image.png /slideshow 0.5`
    starts JPEGView in slideshow with image switching at 0.5s intervals, beginning with given image or folder.
    * E.g.: `JPEGView.exe /slideshow 2`
    (**modified in mod**) starts JPEGView in image selection mode, and then starts slideshow with image switching at 2s intervals. (Previously when an image/path is not specified, `/slideshow` is ignored)
* Slideshow no longer paused when jumping into an image from a different folder.
* New `Auto` option for `FolderNavigation` setting.
* During slideshow, block screensaver.
* A little Android-like `toast` to inform of new slideshow fps or interval. Also used for other general notifications of interest.
  * PS: there's an existing toast-like display of zoom factor when zooming - just in a smaller font.

This mod makes it easier to manipulate the slideshow, specifically to pause/resume it, and (shift) up/down its speed.

### Slideshow Custom Interval

Configure slideshow to run at custom interval via `SlideShowCustomInterval` setting in `JPEGView.ini`.
* Default: 5mins
* Specify in secs, mins or hrs; default unit: seconds.
  * E.g.: `0.1` = 0.1s = 10fps, `1s` = 1sec = 1fps, `5m` = 5 mins, `1.5h` = 1.5hrs

Can be activated by **ALT+SHF+R** hotkey.

Alternatively, you may use the `/slideshow` commandline option to specify arbitrary intervals too; so this feature may not really be needed?

### Customizations

JPEGView hotkeys can be customized via the `KeyMap.txt` file.
WARNING: errors will render all hotkeys disabled.
* Available #define's are are in `src/JPEGView/resource.h`. These are the available commands that can be mapped to hotkeys.
* The bottom section are the hotkey mappings to the above commands.

Other useful customizations, refer to this [guide](https://yunharla.wixsite.com/softwaremmm/post/alternate-photo-viewer-for-windows-10-xnview)
* Suggest increasing zoom amount by increasing `MouseWheelZoomSpeed` to 1.5 from 1.0.

### Panning vs Selection Modes

The new default is **panning** mode.
* The old pesky 'Selection mode' can be toggled via 'S' hotkey.
  * In selection mode, left mouse click on image starts rectangular area selection. Once a rectangular area is selected, popup menu offers options of
        * cropping to selection, and
        * zooming to selection.
  * If you wish to select, hit **'S'** to **enter selection mode**. It lasts until exit (hit 'S' again).
  * Navigation panel's zoom mode button has been changed to selection mode.
  * Press **'Z'** to **'quick zoom to selection'**. Like this:
    * Press 'Z'
    * Drag to select area
    * Once area is selected (mouse released), zoom immediately occurs.
    * Resume in panning mode.
    Basically don't ever stay in the pesky selection mode that leave ugly selection boxes defiling the image.
   * Option for selection box to match image aspect ratio.
     * **one of number 1 to 9**: when in selection mode, selects these aspect ratio:
       1. Free
       2. Same as image
       3. 3:2
       4. 4:3
       5. 5:4
       6. 16:9
       7. 16:10
       8. Fixed size
       9. User predefined in settings
* Changed hotkeys
  * Reuse **'S'** for toggling Selection mode.
    * Dunno what 'save/delete param DB' are, but presuming they're infrequently used junk features, their hotkeys 'S' & 'D' are changed to ALT+S/D.
    Hence, update the KeyMap.txt for this change to take effect!
  * Reuse 'Z' for Quick Zoom to Selection mode.
    * Random sort hotkey changed to ALT+Z.
  * CTRL+Z to toggle (left mouse drag) zoom mode.
* **ALT+SHIFT+<arrow key>** for forcing 'fine grain' panning.
  * **SHIFT+<arrow key>** panning now scales up proportionally to larger panning amounts when image is larger than window.
* Can pan till 1 pixels on any edge.
  * If you can't find your out of view image, try zooming, and using the zoom mini-map to pan our image back into view.
* **'-'/'='** (i.e. the ones between numbers and backspace) to zoom out/in for keyboards without Numpad -/+ keys.

### Transparency

Currently, alpha channel appears to be blended into RGB pixels. Thus, alpha data is 'lost', and won't be saved. This is done in `LoadImageThread.cpp`'s `WebpAlphaBlendBackground()`. CJPEGImage does not seem to bother with alpha channel.

For now, added ability to toggle transparency between checkerboard pattern and solid colour background, via SHIFT-V hotkey. Update your `KeyMap.txt` as usual.

Now calls the blend alpha for all image types.

### Filter

For simplicity, toggling hide small or hidden images triggers a reload of image and folders, and restarts from beginning.
This is to avoid major rework of `CFileList` to either track these hidden images separately and sort them back into the internal lists as needed; or to have even more complicated (and possibly error prone) looping logic to get the next/previous image.

Configure in `JPEGView.ini`:
* Minimum filesize: `MinFilesize`, default: 30K.
  * Specify in bytes, KB or MB like so: 30720, 30K or 1M 
* Enable hide hidden images and folders: `HideHidden`, default: true.

### [Experimental] Asynchronous FileList

mez0ru has a [PR](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/pull/172) for [Issue: Slow startup when opening a file in a highly populated folder](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/issues/194).

I've tried it out a _mod_ of it on a folder with 25k small images. Differences:
* If app is launched with an image specified (instead of a folder), it will show that image (by adding it to the file list) first. Asynchronous loading of files in that image's folder, is started thereafter. This ensures that initial image is quickly displayed.
* Limit code changes to FileList.cpp/h files only.
* NextFolder() does NOT play well with async load, as underlying FindFileRecursively() & TryCreateFileList() will mistakenly discard all folders thinking they are empty, and stay in original folder. So we've to force a full load, and lose the benefit of async-load of child/parallel folders.
This needs more work!
  * Perhaps rework FindFiles() into 2 parts: (1) return 1st file found (to let FindFileRecursively() succeed in retaining non-empty folders) and (2) return rest of files.

From timing printouts, it does help 'significantly'.
However 'by feel', perhaps owing to my defragmented drive, opening an image in a folder with 25k is still _very fast_ (< 1s)! Thus, I can't really test other situations like jumping 100 images, etc. As such, I'll leave this patch as is, for now.

### Wishlist

* Filter images by date, like show newest images only?
* Gestures?
  * Double finger drag pan while zoom.
  * Swipe gestures to skip images at varying amounts depending on swiping speed. Generally, add control via gestures.
* Proper support for transparent images.
  * At least preserve transparency for non-edit saves to a different image format?
* Quality options for 'Save image'. At least save as equivalent quality.
* Save animated WEBP?

# Developer Notes

These notes are here in case anyone wishes to further enhance JPEGView =D and meddle with the troublesome-to-build avif+aom stuff.

## AVIF Image Format
![](https://github.com/sdneon/jpegview/releases/download/v1.1.41.3-beta/gentle-fists.avif)
(this is an animated AVIF; it doesn't animate if your browser does not support)

Support for viewing of AVIF images is via [AOMediaCodec/libavif](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/) + [Alliance for Open Media](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom).
* JPEGView uses `avif.dll` from libavif; JPEGView requires `avif.lib` from libavif.
  * Load AVIF image: `libavif\examples\avif_example_decode_file.c` example is adapted into JPEGView's `ImageLoadThread.cpp`, `CImageLoadThread::ProcessReadAVIFRequest()` method, with reference to `ProcessReadWEBPRequest()`.
  * Save As AVIF image: `libavif\examples\avif_example_encode.c` example is adapted into JPEGView's `SaveImage.cpp`, `CAvifEncoder` class.
     * Save is extremely slow, so have patience!
     * JPEGView's 'Save As' dialog box is simplistic, so no choice of image quality.
       * JPEGView uses WTL's CFileDialog instead of MFC's. The latter has AddEditBox() et al, that could be used to add options selection. WTL's can't; so much rework is needed to add customizable options.
       * Choice of lossy or lossless is via file extension filter selection.
       * AVIF save quality defaults to 60 (on a scale up to 100).
     * Can now save animated AVIF too.
       * You may also try creating AVIF at [this ezgif website](https://ezgif.com/avif-maker) using a series of images.
* libavif issues:
  *  [Resolved] c-based, using malloc/free for image buffer allocation - this has been modded in JPEGView to follow the latter's convention in using new[]/delete[] so as to let it (CJPEGImage) manage freeing of the memory itself.
  *  [Resolved] uses char filenames, unlike JPEGView which uses wchar_t. Switched to use of `avifDecoderSetIOMemory` instead of `avifDecoderSetIOFile`, so images with unicode filenames can now be opened.
     *  Though the original way letting libavif handle file read seems a tad more stable. There's less chance of animated AVIF image frame load error when switching image rapidly.
* aom's `aom.lib` seems statically linked into libavif to produce `avif.lib`, so its aom.dll is not needed by JPEGView.
* Tested on AVIF sample images from [https://github.com/link-u/avif-sample-images/](link-u/avif-sample-images)
    * Afternote: incorporated [qbnu](https://github.com/qbnu)'s portion using alternate HEIC/dav1d decoder, most if not all flavours AVIFs can now be decoded.
      * libavif+aom will still be used for reading/writing animated AVIF, and writing to AVIF.
    * `CJPEGImage` class only handles 8bpp images? So higher bpp images are 'downgraded' to 8bpp.
* Added code for EXIF data extraction using `Helpers::FindEXIFBlock(pBuffer, nFileSize)`, but Not yet tested.

### Building aom

Roughly follow the steps in [aom's guide](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom) and roughly as such (for building in Win 7):
* Clone [aom repo](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom)
* These tools are needed. Install them:
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. Don't use VS2017, something will fail.
  * CMake. Must be sufficiently new version in order to have (VS project generator for >= VS2019).
  * [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/)
  * [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). There's another Perl listed by [perl.org](https://www.perl.org/) but that's troublesome needing registration to download.
*  Open Developer Tools for VS2019 command prompt, launch CMake GUI from it.
    * For 'Where the source code is', select the cloned aom folder.
    * Create a new folder, say 'aom_build', elsewhere for CMake & build output.
    * Check the (key) Name-Value pairs to ensure these are properly (detected and) filled in:
        * AS_EXECUTABLE = <path to NASM's exe>
        * PERL_EXECUTABLE = <path to Perl's exe>
    * Click the 'Configure' button. Hopefully there're no errors, so as to be able to move to the next step. If not, good luck resolve any errors.
    * Click the 'Generate' button to generate VS solution and projects files. If all goes well, click the 'Open Project' button to open in VS2019 =)
    * Probably only need to initate build on the `aom` project to get `aom.lib`. Build will take quite some time as dependencies are built.
        * Desired output: `aom_build/Release/aom.lib` which is needed by libavif below.

### Building libavif

* Download and unzip one of [libavif's latest release](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/releases).
* These tools are needed. Install them:
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
  * CMake. Must be sufficiently new version in order to have (VS project generator for >= VS2019).
  * [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html) (2024).
    * Install using Python. E.g.:
      ```
      c:
      cd c:\p\Python3\Scripts
      pip3 install meson
      ```
    * Set in CMake GUI: MESON_EXECUTABLE to C:/P/Python3/Scripts/meson.exe
  * [RustC Compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (2024). Needed to build AVIF_CODEC_RAV1E.
    * Its command-prompt style installer installs to %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin.
* These libraries are needed. Find, download and unzip them. Not sure if they're really needed for `avif.lib`, but CMake will scream and break if their Name-Value info aren't filled in. The (key) Name's in CMake are:
    * LIBYUV_INCLUDE_DIR & LIBYUV_LIBRARY (2024)
    * JPEG_LIBRARY_DEBUG / JPEG_LIBRARY_RELEASE (< 2024)
      * https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/deps/libjpeg_turbo/ <- Not CMake project
        * Needed by libyuv
        * Manually create new VS solution...
          * In jerror.h, comment out the `#if JPEG_LIB_VERSION >= #0` for missing error code definitions.
          * In tjutil.j, change to '_stricmp' to `#define strcasecmp _stricmp`.
          * Exclude .c files included in .c files! Like jdcol565.c.
    * PNG_LIBRARY_DEBUG / PNG_LIBRARY_RELEASE (< 2024)
      * https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/libpng/ <- Not CMake project
      * Manually create new VS solution...
        * Needs extra file of zconf.h: http://dlib.net/dlib/external/zlib/zconf.h.html
        * Exclude pngtest.c
        * #define PNG_eXIf_SUPPORTED in libpng/pnglibconf.h! to avoid libavif build encoutnering undefined PNG_eXIf_SUPPORTED.
    * ZLIB_LIBRARY_DEBUG / ZLIB_LIBRARY_RELEASE (< 2024)
      * https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/zlib/ <- CMake project
    * Source: https://chromium.googlesource.com/
      * https://chromium.googlesource.com/libyuv/libyuv/ -> needs JPEG_INCLUDE_DIR, JPEG_LIBRARY_DEBUG & JPEG_LIBRARY_RELEASE
        * Specify the .lib for the DEBUG & RELEASE
*  Open Developer Tools for VS2019 command prompt, launch CMake GUI from it.
    * For 'Where the source code is', select the unzipped libavif folder.
    * Create a new folder, say 'libavif_build', elsewhere for CMake & build output.
    * Check these (key) Name-Value pairs to ensure these are properly (detected and) filled in: JPEG_LIBRARY_*, PNG_LIBRARY_* and ZLIB_LIBRARY_*
    * Tick these (key) Name's:
        * `AVIF_CODEC_AOM` -> LOCAL, and `AVIF_CODEC_AOM_ENCODE` & `AVIF_CODEC_AOM_DECODE` -> ticked
          * Do NOT choose `AVIF_CODEC_AVM` (experimental AV2) along with AOM, as CMake will be confused and "can't find sources" to generate VS project files.
          * Do NOT choose `AVIF_CODEC_LIBGGAV1` - it (release ver; debug version is ok) fails for some frames in animated AVIF!
        * Leave `AVIF_CODEC_DAV1D` as `OFF` to avoid 'unresolved external symbol ___chkstk_ms' & __mingw_vfprintf link errors!
        * These are ok (set to LOCAL): AVIF_CODEC_GAV1, AVIF_CODEC_RAV1E, AVIF_CODEC_SVT.
        * `AOM_INCLUDE_FOLDER`: fill in the 'aom' folder path from earlier, like `c:/aom`.
        * `AOM_LIBRARY`: fill in the earlier, like `c:/aom_build/Release/aom.lib`
    * Click the 'Configure' button.
      * Hopefully there're no errors, so as to be able to move to the next step. If not, good luck resolve any errors.
      * Otherwise, change the missing settings and re-click Configure to try again, until all's well.
    * Click the 'Generate' button to generate VS solution and projects files. If all goes well, click the 'Open Project' button to open in VS2019 =)
    * Probably only need to initate build on the `ext/avif/avif` project to get `avif.lib` & `avif.dll`.
        * Optional: build `ext/avid/examples/avif_example_decode_file` project to get a .EXE to test decoding AVIF images.
        * Many project may fail to build (like owing to bad jpeg libs, etc), but they probably don't matter / aren't needed.
        * Desired output: `libavif_build/avif.lib` and `avif.dll`, which are needed by JPEGView =)

### Building JPEGView
The above `avif.lib` then goes into `src\JPEGView\libavif\lib64`.
`avif.dll` goes to `src\JPEGView\bin\x64\Release` and/or Debug folder.
These are added in `JPEGView.vcxproj`'s configuration.

Simply build using the VS solution file.

## [Experimental WIP] Browse Manga/Comics
Support viewing manga/comics in CBZ archives from v1.2.60.
* Image formats: JXL, JPG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF/HEIF, QOI, BMP, RAW.
* Uses [kuba zip](https://github.com/kuba--/zip) which wraps around the minimal 1-file [miniz zip library](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz).
  * Kuba/miniz is good as there's a minimal set of only 3 files total!
* Reuses part of the image loading codes.
  * Some image loaders read from disk instead of memory, so are not easily portable/reusable to decode CBZ's image contents in memory. Hence, ignores all special handling, such as for animation and colour profiles.
     * Incompatible formats/loaders: GDI+ (GIF, BMP), WIC, PSD.
     * Reworked and added a ReaderBMP method to read from memory. It has another untidy bit: it creates the CJPEGImage instead of CImageLoadThread caller, as other loaders do.
       * Same for RAW.
  * Not all combos are tested. Mainly tested: JXL in CBZ. Minimal test: Some RAW and AVIF in CB7, PNG & BMP in CBZ.
  * Known issues:
     * [Fixed in v1.2.61] miniz: unable to uncompress files beyond ~2MB, such as BMP images. Found a quick fix, but don't know why it is so.
    * compilation problem ('incomplete' file): so have to disable usage of precompilied headers in JPEGView.
    * JxlReader has a memory leak. It is supplied a pBuffer allocated by CImageLoadThread, but randomly deallocates it or not.
* Reworked navigation keys to page through the archive's images when in manga/CBZ mode.
* [WIP] v1.2.70: added use of bit7z wrapper with 7z library to read CB7 (i.e. 7zip archive). And etc.?
  * Removed ZIP from file (extension) filter to avoid trying to read non-comics archives. Added CB7 to file filters.
  * Pre-built bit7z DLL is without auto format detection! Thus, needed to build our own copy with BIT7Z_AUTO_FORMAT option enabled.
    * Building bit7z is reasonably easy. Use CMake to configure it with BIT7Z_AUTO_FORMAT enabled, and various options as desired. Generate VS project files and build.

## ICO Image Format
ICO file can contain multiple icons of various sizes.
WICLoader can read the 'frame' count, i.e. number of images. It has been modified to find the largest one amongst them and extract that image.

Official releases will be made to [sylikc's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/releases) page.  Each release includes:
* **Archive Zip/7z** - Portable
* **Windows Installer MSI** - For Installs
  *  For AVIF & [JPEG XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XL) images, you will need to install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2022) as well if your PC does not already have that.

* **Source code** - Build it yourself

### Mod Releases

2 zip files:
* `JPEGView-less-config.zip` - (one purely of the executable and DLLs) for updating your copy, without overriding your existing configuration files.
  * You will have to merge new config settings yourselves. E.g.: `SlideShowCustomInterval`.
* `JPEGView.zip` - full package for unzip and run. Includes above Plus all config/translation/etc files.

## "Portable"

JPEGView _does not require installation_ to run.  Just **unzip, and run** either the 64-bit version, or the 32-bit version depending on which platform you're on.  It can save the settings to the extracted folder and run entirely portable.

### Mostly
With the addition of support for AVIF and especially JPEG XL, _additional VC redistributable DLLs_ are needed. This is owing to their dependency on [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2022)'s trio of vcruntime140.dll, vcruntime140_1.dll, and msvcp140.dll - which in turn requires many other VC DLLs!

These DLLs are now packed in the mod's
* `JPEGView.zip`'s `extras` folder in case you need them.
  * Try running JPEGView without using them - you may already have the VCRedist installed for other apps.
  * If fail, move the DLLs out from `extras` folder to the same folder as JPEGView.exe. It should then work.
* `JPEGView.Setup.msi` installer - this will by default install the DLLs in JPEGView's folder.
  * If you already have a proper VCRedist installation, you may skip this set's installation by going into Advanced options and deselect "VCRedist for AVIF and JXL".

### Mod Update Portable Apps Version

Strangely, there's a [portable app version of JPEGView](https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/jpegview_portable) on [portableapps.com](https://portableapps.com/).

To use this mod, simply replace the JPEGView.exe, *.DLL, JPEGView.ini and KeyMap.txt in the `App/JPEGView` sub-folder.

## MSI Installer

For those who prefer to have JPEGView installed for All Users, a 32-bit/64-bit installer is available to download starting with v1.0.40.

(Unfortunately, I don't own a code signing certificate yet, so the MSI release is not signed.  Please verify checksums!)

### WinGet

If you're on Windows 11, or Windows 10 (build 1709 or later), you can also download it directly from the official [Microsoft WinGet tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) repository.  This downloads the latest MSI installer directly from GitHub for installation.

Example Usage:

C:\> `winget search jpegview`
```
Name     Id              Version  Source
-----------------------------------------
JPEGView sylikc.JPEGView 1.1.43  winget

## PortableApps

Another option is to use the official [JPEGView on PortableApps](https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/jpegview_portable) package.  The PortableApps launcher preserves user settings in a separate directory from the extracted application directory.  This release is signed.

## System Requirements

* 64-bit version: Windows 7/8/10/11 64-bit or later
Mod only tested for >= Win 7 64 bit.

# Brief History

This GitHub repo continues the legacy (is a "fork") of the excellent project [JPEGView by David Kleiner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/).  Unfortunately, starting in 2020, the SourceForge project has essentially been abandoned, with the last update being [2018-02-24 (1.0.37)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/files/jpegview/).  It's an excellent lightweight image viewer that I use almost daily!

The starting point for this repo was a direct clone from SourceForge SVN to GitHub Git.  By continuing this way, it retains all previous commits and all original author comments.  

I'm hoping with this project, some devs might help me keep the project alive!  It's been awhile, and could use some new features or updates.  Looking forward to the community making suggestions, and devs will help with some do pull requests as some of the image code is quite a learning curve for me to pick it up. -sylikc
